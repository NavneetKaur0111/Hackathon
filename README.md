# Hackathon

This is a live working chatbot(AI) made by using an open-source project named RASA and using tech-slack(React, javascript, nlu, yaml). 
It can respond to the user's questions quickly and easily and the most amazing thing is the more people interacts with this bot, the more it get's trained easily.

This is a project for a Hackathon by IQmetrix and Technation
