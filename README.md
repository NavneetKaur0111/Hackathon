# Hackathon
This is a project for an [National Hackathon](https://technationcanada.ca/en/events/iqmetrix-hackathon/) oraganized by [IQmetrix](https://www.iqmetrix.com/) and [Technation](https://technationcanada.ca/en/).

We need to find a problem that retail-business that are looking to work with iQmetrix might faced during and pandemic, and to solve that problem we have to come up with a potential solution.

This is a live working chatbot(AI) made by using an open-source project named RASA and using tech-slack(React, javascript, nlu, yaml). 
It can respond to the user's questions quickly and easily and the most amazing thing is the more people interacts with this bot, the more it get's trained easily.
